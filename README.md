# BookSwap-with-Php
This is a php coded system that acts as a basic backbone to a book swapping kind of system where we have functionalities such as :  add book
      borrow book
      swap book
      alerts
and also it includes the basic login/register functions.

It is actually a very good functioning system easy to understand,so feel free to go through it and use it to create a basic understanding of a similar system that you will be creating.
